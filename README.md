# jekyll-asciidoc-base
jekyll minima based site project with asciidoc support enabled

This is my base project to start new [Ruby based server site generator](https://jekyllrb.com) static websites.

Because I prefer asciidoc it includes predefined plugins to support asciidoc based posts right from the start.

Lead plugin is the [jekyll-asciidoc plugin](https://github.com/asciidoctor/jekyll-asciidoc).
Additionally asciidoctor-diagram is activated. 
Also pygments for syntax highlighting.

And at least [jekyll-archives](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-archives) to create lists of used tags and categories.

To test this just clone the repository and call

```bash
bundle install
jekyll serve
```
